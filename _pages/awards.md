## World Computer Shogi Championships

I used to be involved in Yasushi Tanase's ISshogi project together with Norifumi Gotoh, and Ayumu Nagai
from 1997 until 2005.
We developed one of the best computer Shogi (Japanese chess) programs.
I mainly worked on a high-performance tsume-shogi solver. 

Our shogi software was sold as commercial products (Todai Shogi Series, **東大将棋シリーズ**) on Windows, PlayStation,
PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and so on for more than 10 years.
Below are our results on computer shogi championships:

1. 4th prize out of top 8 programs at the 3rd International Shogi Forum (ISF), 10/2005
1. 3rd prize out of 39 participants at the 15th World Computer Shogi Championship (WCSC), 5/2005
1. 3rd prize out of 43 participants at the 14th WCSC, 5/2004
